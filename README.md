# Exposing Shadow Banning in Social Media Campaigns

## Overview

**Shadow banning**—also known as stealth banning, ghost banning, or algorithmic suppression—is a covert practice by which social media platforms limit the visibility of content without notifying the user. Often, users see their posts but receive drastically reduced engagement because their content doesn't appear in hashtag feeds, search results, or follower timelines :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

This insidious form of moderation is especially problematic for campaigns and human rights advocacy—take the case of Gaza, for example. Multiple investigations have documented how pro-Palestinian content has been suppressed:

- Meta platforms have been accused of limiting posts using hashtags like *FreePalestine* and *IStandWithPalestine*, with many users reporting sudden drops in views and reach :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- During the 2021 Sheikh Jarrah protests, pro-Palestinian voices were systematically shadow-banned, with content removed or visibility reduced under claims of “technical issues” :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- Digital rights groups like 7amleh have documented repeated cases of reduced engagement, censorship, and Arabic moderation bias :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- Human Rights Watch’s December 2023 report highlights systemic suppression of Palestinian content on Facebook and Instagram via algorithmic filtering and lack of appeal pathways :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

## Motivation

For human rights campaigns (and specifically Gaza advocacy), shadow banning can devastate outreach efforts, disrupt information flows, and result in self-censorship by content creators wary of being suppressed. Transparent, real-time monitoring and proof-based reporting of these invisible restrictions are essential to hold platforms accountable and preserve freedom of expression.

## Project Goals & Approach

We are building a platform to **expose shadow banning through real-time data collection and evidence-driven reporting**:

- **Real-time Monitoring**  
  Track reach, impressions, hashtag visibility, and engagement metrics across platforms for posts on Gaza-related content.

- **Detection Indicators**  
  Identify anomalous drops in engagement — especially after certain keywords, hashtags, or content types are used.

- **Proof-Based Reporting**  
  Archive comparisons (e.g., same post with/without key hashtags), screenshot evidence, and aggregated analytics.

- **Public Dashboard & Alerts**  
  Share findings via dashboards and alerts to affected communities and the media.

- **Platform Engagement**  
  Where feasible, reach out to platforms with documented cases as part of advocacy efforts.
